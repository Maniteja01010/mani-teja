Q1> What is Normalization And Standardization?

-->Normalization: Scaling data to a range of [0, 1].
Used when features have different units or scales.
Example: Min-Max Scaling.
-->Standardization: Scaling data to have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.
Useful for algorithms like SVM, Ridge, and Lasso.

Q2>How to Address Multicollinearity?

Techniques:
-->Use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect highly collinear features and remove them.
-->Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.
-->Apply Ridge Regression, which penalizes large coefficients to mitigate multicollinearity.
